# When `text` is set to "auto", the path is marked for automatic end-of-line conversion.
# If Git decides that the content is text, its line endings are converted to LF on checkin.
# When the file has been committed with CRLF, no conversion is done.

# Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.
*.bat text eol=crlf

# Declare files that will always have LF line endings on checkout.
*.sh text eol=lf


# These files are text and should be normalized (Convert crlf => lf)
# Setting the `text` attribute on a path enables end-of-line normalization and marks the path as a text file.
# End-of-line conversion takes place without guessing the content type.
